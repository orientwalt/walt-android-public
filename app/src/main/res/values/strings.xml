        <item>On a public chain, anyone can read and write data. Reading data is free, but writing
            data to the public chain costs a certain amount of money, which helps prevent garbage

            connection device that contains a copy of the account is called a node) can participate
            in a way called mining to protect the network. Because mining requires computing power

            blockchain address for the transfer operation, which involves a valid record of the

        <item>First confirm whether the payment address filled in the transfer is the exchange
            address,
            personal address or smart contract address. Because all transfer transactions happen on
            the blockchain,
            once the transaction is completed, there is no way to modify the blockchain data to
            withdraw or cancel the transaction,
            and the token can only be transferred back by the recipient. \n
                        If you fill in the address of the exchange, then all the tokens you
            transferred have been transferred to the exchange\'s wallet address, please contact the
            exchange customer service, let them transfer your misdirected token back to your wallet.
            \n
                        If you are filling in a personal address, you can contact the other party to
            return the token. If you can\'t get the personal information of the holder of the
            currency address, there is no way to transfer the token back. \n
                        If you are filling out a smart contract address, please contact the contract
            developer to return your token. \n
                        It is recommended to carefully confirm the correctness of the receipt
            address and avoid asset loss before initiating the transfer transaction.

                        1. When the user deletes the wallet, there is no backup wallet. \n
                        We recommend that users back up their wallets immediately after creating
            their wallets, using both dual backup and multiple backup strategies. Double backup
            refers to keystore backup and mnemonic backup, multiple backup refers to backup of
            keystore
                        After the mnemonic and the mnemonic, verify that the backup is correct,
            repeat the verification, and confirm that it is correct. \n
                        2. The user has forgotten the Keystore password\n
                        We recommend that users encrypt the Keystore with a stronger password. This
            password is preferably a random, non-common password generated by the user. \n
                        3. Lost private key\n
                        The private key here includes mnemonic, keystore and plaintext private key.
            Some users do not verify after copying the mnemonic, or they are too scribbled, which
            makes it difficult to identify later.
                        These will lead to the inability to find your own wallet. Therefore, we must
            be careful when backing up the wallet. When you keep your wallet in the future, you
            should be good at using some secure management tools to ensure that you can find the
            private key at any time. \n
                        4. Back up the wrong wallet\n
                        Backing up the wrong wallet means that the user has two wallets in Walt, for
            example, one is the A wallet and the other is the B wallet. When the user wants to back
            up the A wallet, it is backed up incorrectly.
                        The private key of the wallet. Therefore, we recommend that after you back
            up your wallet, be sure to import the backup private key into your wallet to verify that
            the backup is correct.</item>       
        <item>First, realize that your private key may be leaked, replace your wallet immediately,
            and make a wallet backup. Then, quickly transfer the assets of your wallet to the new
            wallet. And check out the situation where you may reveal your private key</item>        
        <item>You can add, store or remove digital tokens (except ETH and BTC) supported by Walt
            from the Walt operator interface.</item>        
        <item>We will copy all or part of your transaction history through the blockchain system.
            However, the user should take the latest transaction record of the blockchain system as
            the standard.</item>       
        <item>In the decentralized wallet, all users\' authentication content, such as transaction
            password, private key, and mnemonic, are stored locally on the user\'s mobile phone and
            are not stored in the centralized server. All users forget the password. Third party
            agencies to reset.
        </item>
        <item>refers to some of the Walt software code that the company publicly announces open
            source, allowing developers to use (including secondary development) the part of the
            open source code in compliance with the relevant open source agreement and the notice of
            the company.</item> 
        <item>Mnemonic words need to be used in conjunction with paths, and the same mnemonic words
            can generate different addresses in conjunction with different paths. Walt\'s HTDF
            default path is m\'44\'346\'0\'0, and USDP\'s default path is m\'44\'345\'0\'0. If you
            import mnemonics and want to change the path, a new wallet address will be generated. Be
            sure to remember your own path. If you set a custom path and then forget it when you
            import mnemonics, you may lose your wallet.</item> 
        <item>The 3.1.4 version starts using the standard BSV path m\'44\'346\'0\'0. The
            path of the old version is the same as that of the BCH. To recover the BSV assets of the
            old version of the asset, please use the BCH private key import to find.
